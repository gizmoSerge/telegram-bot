# Telegram Bot with OpenAI Integration

## Description
This repository contains a Python script for a Telegram bot (`telebot_3.py`) that integrates OpenAI's language model for intelligent interactions. The bot uses Aiogram for handling Telegram bot operations and AsyncOpenAI for querying OpenAI's language model. It's designed to connect to a PostgreSQL database using asyncpg for data handling.

## Features
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Uses Aiogram for creating and managing bot interactions on Telegram.
- **OpenAI Language Model**: Integrates with OpenAI using AsyncOpenAI for intelligent, automated responses.
- **Database Connectivity**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database using asyncpg for efficient data management.
- **Command Handling**: Includes functionality to handle different commands sent to the Telegram bot.

## Setup and Configuration
- **Config File**: Ensure all necessary configurations (API keys, database credentials) are set in a `config.py` file (not included for security reasons).
- **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` (if available).

## Usage
1. Configure the necessary API keys and database details in `config.py`.
2. Run `telebot_3.py` to start the Telegram bot.
3. Interact with the bot on Telegram using predefined commands.

## Security Note
This script requires sensitive information like API keys and database credentials. Ensure these are securely stored and not exposed in public repositories.

## Disclaimer
This bot is intended for educational and development purposes. Be mindful of the ethical implications and usage policies of both OpenAI and Telegram.
